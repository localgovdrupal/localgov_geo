# LocalGov Drupal: Geo

Provides a entity for storing, and reusing, geographic information.

Pre-configured to use openstreetmap tiles, and geocoder openstreetmap backend.
The intention is that this can be exchanged for preferred services. More detail
about gecoder options can be found on the [Installing new Geocoders page](https://github.com/localgovdrupal/localgov_geo/wiki/Installing-new-Geocoders-%5BFAQ:-%22Why-doesn't-it-find-...%22%5D)

There are two default bundle types, address and area.

There is [an overview of the bundles and reusing addresses on the wiki](https://github.com/localgovdrupal/localgov_geo/wiki/Locations-Module-(LocalGov-Geo)).
